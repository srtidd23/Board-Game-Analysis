If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    ","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","images":{"thumb":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/40x40/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","small":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/150x150/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","medium":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/350x350/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","large":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg","original":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254186140-51iNoyxoamL.jpg"},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/6FmFeux5xH/pandemic","price":"33.97","msrps":[{"country":"US","price":39.99}],"discount":"0.15","primary_publisher":{"id":"UPqP0MXLqj","name":"Z-Man Games, Inc.","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/UPqP0MXLqj/zman-games-inc"},"publishers":[{"id":"UPqP0MXLqj","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/UPqP0MXLqj/undefined","images":{}},{"id":"vJkLBDgn1j","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/vJkLBDgn1j/undefined","images":{}},{"id":"b33BrKkCsN","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/b33BrKkCsN/undefined","images":{}},{"id":"UMssR9EGlp","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/UMssR9EGlp/undefined","images":{}}],"mechanics":[{"id":"oeg6wN9Eoc","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/oeg6wN9Eoc/undefined"},{"id":"hwyCo1W0hi","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/hwyCo1W0hi/undefined"},{"id":"9mNukNBxfZ","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/9mNukNBxfZ/undefined"},{"id":"WPytek5P8l","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/WPytek5P8l/undefined"},{"id":"MEAoOygZsA","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/MEAoOygZsA/undefined"},{"id":"lA3KUtVFCy","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/lA3KUtVFCy/undefined"},{"id":"AVY6EvSQTP","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/AVY6EvSQTP/undefined"},{"id":"XM2FYZmBHH","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/XM2FYZmBHH/undefined"}],"categories":[{"id":"AeWXMxbm91","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/AeWXMxbm91/undefined"}],"designers":[{"id":"DKHpfErJB9","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/DKHpfErJB9/undefined","images":{}}],"developers":[],"artists":["Joshua Cappel","Régis Moulun","Chris Quilliams"],"names":["Pandemic: 10th Anniversary Edition","EPIZOotic","Pandemia","Pandemia 10 Aniversario","Pandemia: Una Nuova Sfida","Pandemic, 10 Jahre Jubiläumsedition","Pandemic, Edición 10º Aniversario","Pandemic: Edition 10ème anniversaire","Pandemic: Una nuova sfida","Pandémie","Pandemie","Πανδημία","Пандемия","เกมโรคระบาด","パンデミック","パンデミック：新たなる試練","瘟疫危機 (瘟疫危机)","팬데믹"],"num_user_ratings":734,"average_user_rating":3.5856403635367977,"official_url":"https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/pandemic?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads","rules_url":"https://images-cdn.zmangames.com/us-east-1/filer_public/25/12/251252dd-1338-4f78-b90d-afe073c72363/zm7101_pandemic_rules.pdf","weight_amount":2.3,"weight_units":"lbs","size_height":12,"size_depth":1.7,"size_units":"inches ","matches_specs":null,"spec":[],"rank":7,"trending_rank":0,"primary_designer":{"id":"DKHpfErJB9","name":"Matt Leacock","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/DKHpfErJB9/matt-leacock"}},{"id":"7NYbgH2Z2I","name":"Viticulture: Essential Edition","year_published":2015,"min_players":1,"max_players":6,"min_playtime":90,"max_playtime":120,"min_age":13,"description":"<p>Viticulture is a worker-placement game set in the foothills of Tuscany.

Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.

They will collect the weapons, wood, and food needed to build ships, carve runes and send their warriors across the sea to defeat the most savage beasts and earn the glory befitting a champion.  \"The combat is what sets this game apart from other games in the genre,\" says Joshua Lobkowicz, Head of Game Development at Grey Fox Games. \"It's as approachable as Lords of Waterdeep but with the added thrill of rolling handfuls of Viking Warrior Dice in an attempt to kill awesome monsters.\" ","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","images":{"thumb":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/40x40/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","small":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/150x150/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","medium":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/350x350/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","large":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg","original":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254152677-61-TxEzoAJL.jpg"},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/zBikUpC51l/champions-of-midgard","price":"17.95","msrps":[{"country":"US","price":42.99}],"discount":"0.58","primary_publisher":{"id":"Eldb8KQw4u","name":"Grey Fox Games","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/Eldb8KQw4u/grey-fox-games"},"publishers":[{"id":"Eldb8KQw4u","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/Eldb8KQw4u/undefined","images":{}}],"mechanics":[{"id":"R0bGq4cAl4","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/R0bGq4cAl4/undefined"},{"id":"wV5peB05xs","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/wV5peB05xs/undefined"},{"id":"lA3KUtVFCy","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/lA3KUtVFCy/undefined"},{"id":"XM2FYZmBHH","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/XM2FYZmBHH/undefined"},{"id":"fBOTEBUAmV","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/fBOTEBUAmV/undefined"}],"categories":[{"id":"KUBCKBkGxV","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/KUBCKBkGxV/undefined"},{"id":"ZTneo8TaIO","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/ZTneo8TaIO/undefined"},{"id":"upXZ8vNfNO","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/upXZ8vNfNO/undefined"},{"id":"QAYkTHK1Dd","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/QAYkTHK1Dd/undefined"},{"id":"MHkqIVxwtx","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/MHkqIVxwtx/undefined"}],"designers":[{"id":"oXyK6JYzQt","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/oXyK6JYzQt/undefined","images":{}}],"developers":[],"artists":["Víctor Pérez Corbella"],"names":["Champions of Midgard","Campioni di midgard","Champions de Midgard","Wojownicy Midgardu","Чемпионы Мидгарда"],"num_user_ratings":196,"average_user_rating":3.824507389162561,"official_url":"https://www.greyfoxgames.com/games/champions-of-midgard/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads","rules_url":"http://www.greyfoxgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Champions-of-Midguard-Rulebook-Small-File.pdf","weight_amount":2,"weight_units":"lbs ","size_height":12,"size_depth":12,"size_units":"inches ","matches_specs":null,"spec":[],"rank":78,"trending_rank":0,"primary_designer":{"id":"oXyK6JYzQt","name":" Ole Steiness","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/oXyK6JYzQt/-ole-steiness"}},{"id":"fxxi8zX7L9","name":"Suburbia","year_published":2012,"min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_playtime":90,"max_playtime":105,"min_age":8,"description":"<p>Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis.

At the beginning of each Round, players will roll their dice and then take turns placing those dice in space on the board for various effects. Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there.<br />Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.<br /><br /><strong>Multiple Strategies</strong><br />There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.<br /><br /><strong>Unique Powers<br /></strong> Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!<br /><br /><strong>Different City Cards Every Game!<br /></strong> With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability.</p>\r\n</div>","description_preview":" \r\n  A Grand Voyage!

Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there. Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.   Multiple Strategies  There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.   Unique Powers   Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!   Different City Cards Every Game!   With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability. \r\n ","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","thumb_url":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","images":{"thumb":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/40x40/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","small":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/150x150/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","medium":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/350x350/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","large":"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg","original":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559255812091-61dG94U7KQL.jpg"},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/jBBIIYQmED/the-voyages-of-marco-polo","price":"42.75","msrps":[{"country":"US","price":50.99}],"discount":"0.16","primary_publisher":{"id":"UPqP0MXLqj","name":"Z-Man Games, Inc.","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/UPqP0MXLqj/zman-games-inc"},"publishers":[{"id":"UPqP0MXLqj","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/UPqP0MXLqj/undefined","images":{}}],"mechanics":[{"id":"jOAB6RhwBp","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/jOAB6RhwBp/undefined"},{"id":"R0bGq4cAl4","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/R0bGq4cAl4/undefined"},{"id":"wV5peB05xs","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/wV5peB05xs/undefined"},{"id":"6RZAs0CCpF","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/6RZAs0CCpF/undefined"},{"id":"lA3KUtVFCy","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/lA3KUtVFCy/undefined"},{"id":"XM2FYZmBHH","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/XM2FYZmBHH/undefined"},{"id":"fBOTEBUAmV","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/fBOTEBUAmV/undefined"},{"id":"B30dz3Ljjx","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/B30dz3Ljjx/undefined"}],"categories":[{"id":"mavSOM8vjH","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/mavSOM8vjH/undefined"},{"id":"N0TkEGfEsF","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/N0TkEGfEsF/undefined"},{"id":"QAYkTHK1Dd","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/QAYkTHK1Dd/undefined"}],"designers":[{"id":"zQj37XE9iU","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/zQj37XE9iU/undefined","images":{}},{"id":"1HFd9t6DSV","num_games":null,"score":9999999,"game":{},"url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/1HFd9t6DSV/undefined","images":{}}],"developers":[],"artists":["Dennis Lohausen"],"names":["marco polo","Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo ","The Voyages of Marco Polo"],"num_user_ratings":185,"average_user_rating":3.9029029029029023,"official_url":"https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/voyages-marco-polo/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads","rules_url":"https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/voyages-marco-polo/","weight_amount":3.78,"weight_units":"lbs","size_height":12.4,"size_depth":2.2,"size_units":"inches","matches_specs":null,"spec":[],"rank":99,"trending_rank":0,"primary_designer":{"id":"zQj37XE9iU","name":"Daniele Tascini","url":"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/zQj37XE9iU/daniele-tascini"}},{"id":"DxWHvojIM1","name":"Agricola","year_published":2007,"min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_playtime":30,"max_playtime":60,"min_age":12,"description":"<p>In <strong>Agricola</strong> (Latin for &quot;farmer&quot;), you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else.
