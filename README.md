# Board-Game-Analysis
An analysis on board game data using Spark and Scala. This will be done to practice skills learned in training and provide insight on how a new board game will do when it comes to market whether through a Kickstarter or a publisher. The current questions are as followed using API calls to [BoardGameAtlas.com](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/):
1) What are the top 10 board games? 
2) Does a board game average user rating have a correlation with its price? What about average playtime?
3) According to the top 500, are multiplayer games more popular than solo only games/games that offer solo? 
4) What is the most popular game mechanic to implement? Which mechanic potentially leads to a higher board game rating?  
5) Which year had the highest average rating of games published?
