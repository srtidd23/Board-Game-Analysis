# Board-Game-Analysis
An analysis on board game data using Spark and Scala. This will be done to practice skills learned in training and provide insight on how a new board game will do when it comes to market whether through a Kickstarter or a publisher. The current questions are as followed using API calls to [BoardGameAtlas.com](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/):
1) What are the top 10 board games? 
2) Does a board game price have a correlation with its potential rank? What about average playtime?
3) According to the top 100, are multiplayer games more popular than solo games? 
4) What is the most popular game mechanic? Which mechanic potentially leads to a higher board game rank?
